# Things

![](assets/main-demo.png)

I love [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/). It's been the task manager I've trusted and used for years, partly because the design makes using the app so enjoyable. I wanted to bring that same joy to Obsidian by creating a Things-inspired design that looked and felt native on MacOS, iOS and iPadOS.

### Features

- Things-inspired color palette
- Light and dark theme
- Desktop and mobile support
- Custom colors for bold, italic and block-quotes
- Tag pills for readability
- Better designed image cards
- Bullet and number list relationship lines
- Fancy cursor based on Things cursor color
- Publish and Sync support
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font and ligatures for code

### Plugin Support

This theme has support for the following Obsidian community plugins:

- [Sliding Panes (Andy's Mode)](https://github.com/deathau/sliding-panes-obsidian)
