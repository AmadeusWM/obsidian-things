I love [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/). It's been the task manager I've trusted and used for years, partly because the design makes using the app so enjoyable. I wanted to bring that same joy to Obsidian by creating a Things-inspired design that looked and felt native on MacOS and iOS.

## Features

- Things-inspired color palette
- Light and dark theme
- Desktop and mobile support
- Customizable colors for bold, italic, highlighters, and block-quotes
- Tag pills for readability
- Better designed image cards
- Bullet and number list relationship lines
- Fancy cursor based on Things cursor color
- Publish and Sync support
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font and ligatures for code

## Supported Plugins

This theme has support for the following Obsidian community plugins:

- [Sliding Panes (Andy's Mode)](https://github.com/deathau/sliding-panes-obsidian)
- [Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin)
- [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban)
- [Hider](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) (recommend hiding titlebar, scroll bars, status bar, and app ribbons)
- [Checklist](https://github.com/delashum/obsidian-checklist-plugin)
- [Todoist](https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin) (ironic, I know)

## Credits

I owe a huge hat tip to both `@kepano` and his Minimal Theme, which served as the base for this theme, and to `@chetachiezikeuzor` and her Yin and Yang Theme for inspiration on building an elegant, native-feeling design!
